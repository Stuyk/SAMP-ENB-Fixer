I cannot stress enough that you must read about using this simple program.

1. Install NodeJS v13+

-   [https://nodejs.org/dist/v13.12.0/node-v13.12.0-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/dist/v13.12.0/node-v13.12.0-x64.msi)

3. Go into your GTA:SA Directory and create a folder called `sampFixer`. It's CaSeSeNsItIvE

4. Open a PowerShell or CommandPrompt in that directory.

5. Type `npm install`

6. Then type `node ./main.js`

That's it! The rest will be taken care of and you should have ENBs running properly after this.
Granted you know what you're doing.

Remember to install mods one at a time when modding.
